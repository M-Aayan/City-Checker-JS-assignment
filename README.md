# City-Checker-JS-assignment
The goal of this assignment is to create a JavaScript program that checks whether the city "Islamabad" exists in a predefined list of Pakistani cities. The program will search for "Islamabad" within the array, and if it is found, it will display an alert with the message:
"Islamabad is the cleanest city of Pakistan!"

How It's Made
Define the Array of Cities:

Create an array containing the names of multiple cities in Pakistan. This list will serve as the data source for the program. The array includes cities like Karachi, Lahore, Multan, Islamabad, and others.
Logic for Searching the City:

Use JavaScript to search the array for the city "Islamabad." This can be achieved using array methods like includes() or a loop to iterate through the list of cities.
Ensure the search is case-sensitive or handle case normalization if needed.
Condition and Alert Message:

If the city "Islamabad" is found in the array, display an alert message saying:
"Islamabad is the cleanest city of Pakistan!"
If not found, the program can silently end or provide feedback, such as another alert indicating the city isn't found (optional).
User Interaction:

The program does not require input from the user. It directly checks the predefined array for the city "Islamabad" and provides feedback.
How It Performs
Initialization:

The program initializes with the predefined array of cities stored in memory.
City Search:

It performs a search operation in the array to determine if "Islamabad" is present.
Condition Check:

If "Islamabad" is found, the program immediately triggers an alert with the designated message:
"Islamabad is the cleanest city of Pakistan!"
Feedback Display:

The alert acts as a response mechanism, informing the user about the success of the search.
End of Execution:

Once the alert is displayed, the program completes its execution.
